This plug-in provides filtering/search functionality to Vim, similar to e.g.
PSPad. This plug-in offers a number of additional features:

- Further filtering/searching inside the filtered results.
- Syntaxt highlighting in the filtered results.
- Show context line around found matches. You can dynamically change the number of lines.
- Easy jumping to and from the filter buffers.

The search results are presented in a seperate buffer (and window) and
the script offers a number of convenience key-mappings to navigate from one
result to the next.

The default key mappings are as follows:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    KEY        Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Any buffer:
    ,f         Filter the current buffer using the line pattern found in
               register @/, that is the search buffer (your last search).
    ,F         Ask for a line pattern and filters using that string.
    ,g         Go to the newest filter window associated with the current
               buffer. If the current buffer is also a filter window, go to
               the next associated filter window that is the newest after the
               current one.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Filter buffer:
    <Enter>    Go to the selected line in the original buffer and keep the filter
               window open. 
    <S-Enter>  Same as <Enter> but also closes the filter buffer.
    c/C        Increase/decrease the number of context lines around matches.
    o          Jump to the currently selected line in the original buffer, but
               keep the cursor in the filter window.
    a          Toggle auto follow. If auto follow is on, the original buffer
               will automatically jump to the line your cursor is on (i.e.
               it's the same effect as pressing o each time you move the
               cursor).
    j/k        Jump to next/previous search result.
